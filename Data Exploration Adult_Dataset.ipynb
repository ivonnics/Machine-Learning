    "The \"Adult Dataset\", also known as the \"Cenus Income\" dataset is from the 1994 Census Database. The Census is a wide-range activity, which takes place once a decade in the entire country. It is a procedure that acquires complete and reliable information such as demographic, social and economic characteristics about people in a given population. The data collected includes age, gender, marital-status, country of origin, employment, education, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The census includes over 200 different surveys taken by a lot of enumerators to get reliable measure about demographics of American people. The most important role of Census is to calculate population distribution. The information makes it possible to plan better services, improve the quality of life of people and solve existing problems. The data was extracted by Barry Becker from 1994 Census Database by collecting clean records using a set of conditions. Each row represents all the data about a specific person, and it could be used to analyze a variety of problems including and not limited to demographic status(using finalwgt, age, gender, country of origin), social and economic status(education and employment related data), etc."

    "3. capital-gain and capital-loss - We can sum up capital gain and loss to have a column \"Net-Capital-Gain\" rather than having two columns representing different values.\n",
