    "We can define a simple univariate problem as a sequence of integers, fit the model on this sequence and have the model predict the next value in the sequence. We will frame the problem to have 3 inputs and 1 output, for example: [10, 20, 30] as input and [40] as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important difference from the MLP model, and like the CNN model, is that the LSTM model expects three-dimensional input with the shape [samples, timesteps, features]. We will define the data in the form [samples, timesteps] and reshape it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define the number of input time steps as 3 and the number of features as 1 via the input_shape argument on the first hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use one LSTM layer to process each input sub-sequence of 3 time steps, followed by a Dense layer to interpret the summary of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses the efficient Adam version of stochastic gradient descent and optimizes the mean squared error ('mse') loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is defined, it can be fit on the training data and the fit model can be used to make a prediction.\n",
